# performance-ATV
As part of my Engineering Practice unit, I was tasked with designing a high-performance rear axle for an ATV.  This project acted as an introductory assignment to our final project which was to design the convertible roof mechanism for the Fiat 595 Abarth. This was a team project which introduced different elements of being able to successfully manufacture a high-performance component of a vehicle. The project required knowledge of interpreting different industry-level catalogues to pick suitable gear sizes, sprockets and bearings. These selections were made using simple gear ratio, transmission and load calculations for the ATV. Overall, this project acted as a nice pre-requisite assignment to introduce the final and more sophisticated convertible roof project that came later in the year.
